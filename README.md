#  SAS REST API Examples
## Overview
This repository contains examples that show the capabilities of SAS REST APIs. You can use these examples for learning or for validating your environment. You are encouraged to contribute your own examples.

The APIs are group into the following categories:

| API Category | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Visualization | Provide access to reports and report images |
| Compute | Act on SAS compute and analytic servers, including Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) | 
| Text Analytics | Provide analysis and categorization of text documents | 
| Data Management | Enable data manipulation and data quality operations on data sources | 
| Decision Management | Provide access to machine scoring and business rules | 
| Core Services | Provide operations for shared resources such as files and folders | 

Within each grouping will be a folder for SAS and User contributions (we encourage external participation).


## Installation/Usage
The examples in this repository offer sample REST API calls, including valid http methods, headers, and body content, where applicable. Sample responses are also included. Requests are submitted by standard REST call methods: Postman, cURL, application code, etc.
