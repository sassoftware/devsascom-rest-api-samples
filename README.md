#  SAS REST API Examples - SAS Viya Preview
## Overview
This is a preview repository containing examples showing the capabilities of SAS REST APIs. You can use these examples for learning or for validating your environment. If you have comments or see needed corrections, please open an issue in GitHub. 

The APIs are group into the following categories:

| API Category        | Description                                                                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Visualization       | Provides access to reports and report images                                      |
| Compute             | Acts on SAS compute and analytic servers, including Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) | 
| Text Analytics      | Provides analysis and categorization of text documents                            | 
| Data Management     | Enables data manipulation and data quality operations on data sources             | 
| Decision Management | Provides access to machine scoring and business rules                             | 
| Core Services       | Provides operations for shared resources such as files and folders                ||
| IoT                 | Provides operations for IoT analytics and Event Stream Processing                 ||

Within each grouping will be a folder for SAS and User contributions (we encourage external participation).
