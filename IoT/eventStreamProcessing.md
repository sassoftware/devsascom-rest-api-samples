# IoT Event Stream Processing APIs

This repository contains SAS contributed examples that show the capabilities of the IoT Event Stream Processing APIs.

* SAS Event Stream Manager is a web-based client that enables you to deploy projects and monitor the state of your SAS Event Stream Processing environment. 
You can use SAS Event Stream Processing Studio to create the projects that you deploy to SAS Event Stream Processing (ESP) servers using SAS Event Stream Manager.

* SAS Event Stream Processing Studio is a web-based client that enables you to create, test, and publish event stream processing models. 
Publishing a project version from SAS Event Stream Processing Studio makes the project version available to SAS Event Stream Manager.

## Examples
* [Import, publish and run projects on Kubernetes cluster](eventStreamProcessing/python/import-and-publish-projects/README.md)
